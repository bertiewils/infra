# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:

version: 2
updates:

  - package-ecosystem: "terraform"
    # Searches the entire tree, but only matches files with the given name
    # This actually outputs without a leading slash, but dependabot doesn't seem to care
    # Note the . is escaped, node-glob doesn't search hidden files by default
    directory: '\.terraform.lock.hcl'
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"

  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"  # Will check the default `.github/workflows`
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
